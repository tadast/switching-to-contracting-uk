# **The 2025 UK IT Contracting Market: What Contractors Are Really Saying**

After seeing a lot of repeated discussions and personal anecdotes about the IT contracting state in the UK, but no single aggregated source of trends or an overview of the overall state, I have decided to run [a survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1JdG_hr2LMi6-Y5-8o3hu4mdWR5kUN2iQ6_lBeDAITQ4/edit).

Huge thanks to everyone who has responded, here's a writeup and interpretation of the results.

[Discuss on UK IT Contractors Discord](https://discord.gg/uteWnwP9CU).

## **Executive Summary: A Tough Gig, But Some Are Still Fighting**

Alright, let's cut to the chase. We've crunched the numbers from 163 UK IT contractors, and the big takeaway is this: the market's a bit of a battlefield right now. Most experienced contractors are feeling pretty grim about it, largely pointing fingers at the IR35 reform as the main villain. Add in economic jitters and big tech layoffs, and you've got a recipe for a challenging landscape.

But it's not all doom and gloom. While many are saying it's "getting harder" or even "not worth it anymore," there are some surprising silver linings, like how global remote hiring and AI are creating new opportunities for a savvy few.

When it comes to rates, it's clear: Outside IR35 is still the golden ticket. Even if an Inside IR35 role *looks* good on paper, the take-home pay often tells a different story. And if you're looking for work, forget waiting for calls – it's a "push" market now, meaning you've got to hustle, and your network (plus recruiters) are your best friends. This whole vibe suggests we might see some top talent ditching UK contracting if things don't shift.


## **1. Who Answered This Survey? (And Why Their Opinions Matter)**

We heard from 163 IT pros, giving us a pretty solid snapshot of the UK contracting scene. What's cool is that this isn't just a bunch of newbies; it's heavily weighted towards seasoned veterans who've seen it all. Their collective sigh of despair about the market carries a lot of weight.


### **The Crowd: Experienced, Remote, and Mostly Private Sector**



* **Who's Contracting?** Just over half (50.3%) are rocking "Outside IR35" contracts, with another 28.8% in "Inside IR35" roles. A decent chunk (19.0%) are former contractors who've jumped back into permanent roles, offering a valuable perspective on why they made the switch.
* **Years in the Game:** This is where it gets interesting. A whopping 37.4% have been contracting for "10+" years, and another 31.3% for "5-10" years. So, we're talking about a very experienced crowd here.
* **Client Setup:** Most (76.7%) are dedicated to "1 client full-time," but a few are juggling "2-3 part-time clients" or "Several fractional roles."
* **Company Size:** "Enterprise (1000+ employees)" clients dominate (56.4%), but SMEs and mid-size companies also feature prominently. What's personally interesting to me is after sharing with my inner circles startups were dominating. The pendulum has swung the other way after posting on Reddit /r/ContractorUK.
* **Sector Split:** The "Private" sector is the main playground (70.6%), but the "Public" sector still makes up a significant chunk (29.4%).
* **Job Roles & Seniority:** "Developer / Software Engineer" is the most common gig (28.2%), followed by "Programme/Project Manager" (15.3%) and "Solution Architect" (9.8%). Most respondents are "Senior" (46.0%) or "Lead / Principal" (30.7%).
* **Work Location:** Remote work is king, with 67.5% working fully remote and another 30.7% doing "Hybrid." The office? Barely a blip (1.8%).


### **Why These Experienced Folks Are So Gloomy: A Red Flag**

The fact that so many long-term contractors (the "10+" years crowd) are saying the "Current market is much worse" or "It's not worth it anymore" is a huge deal. These aren't folks easily rattled by minor market wobbles; they've weathered storms before. Their widespread pessimism suggests something fundamentally broken in the UK IT contracting landscape. If these seasoned pros are feeling the pinch so badly, it could mean a "brain drain" of top talent, either into permanent jobs or even abroad. That's bad news for UK businesses needing flexible, high-skill IT expertise.

## **2. The Nitty-Gritty: What the Survey Actually Said**

Here's a quick rundown of the key findings, hitting the highlights from each question:



* **Market Prospects (vs. 2020):** Over 60% of contractors feel the "Current market is much worse" than a few years ago. Ouch.
* **Rate Changes:** Many (38.0%) had "to reduce" their daily rate, while a significant chunk (31.3%) saw no change for 3+ years. Only 20.9% saw their rates go up.
* **Unwanted Downtime:** More than 60% of contractors faced unplanned downtime in the last year, with durations all over the map.
* **Finding Roles:** "Via a recruiter/agency" (48.0%) and "Directly for past clients/colleagues" (28.7%) are the top ways to land a gig.
* **Inbound Requests:** Most contractors (70.6%) got "None" or just "1-3" unsolicited job offers in the last three months. The good old days of being constantly headhunted seem to be over.
* **Outlook on UK Contracting:** The most common sentiment? "I will try to keep contracting, but it's getting harder" (55.6%). A notable 19.6% are just saying "It's not worth it anymore."
* **Preferred Role Type (Equal Pay):** This is a no-brainer: "Outside IR35 Contract" is overwhelmingly preferred (64.4%), even by those currently stuck Inside. "Permanent role" is a distant second (32.9%).


### **The Big Squeeze: Why Contractors Are Sticking It Out (For Now)**

It's a weird paradox: contractors *love* the idea of "Outside IR35" and the freedom it brings, but the market's making it harder and harder to actually live that dream. The widespread feeling of "it's getting harder" combined with high downtime and rate cuts means many are just trying to survive, not thrive. If this continues, expect a mass exodus. The UK could lose a lot of its agile, skilled IT workforce.


### **The Hunt is On: No More Easy Pickings**

Remember when contractors just waited for calls? Not anymore. The super low number of "Inbound requests" (mostly zero!) tells us the market has flipped. Now, you've got to be proactive, leaning heavily on recruiters and your personal network. One contractor even said, "New the cio, contacted directly, only way to get a job nowadays." This means more competition and a tougher climb for new contractors.


## **3. The Money Talk & How People Get Hired**

Let's dive into the juicy bits: rates and how people are actually landing jobs.


### **3.1. Daily Rates: Outside is Still the Dream**

When we slice and dice the daily rates, the IR35 status is a huge factor.



* **Outside IR35 vs. Inside IR35:**
    * **Outside IR35** roles (80 valid entries) average around **£598.5** per day, with a median of £550.0.
    * **Inside IR35** roles (37 valid entries) average slightly higher at **£610.8**, with a median of £600.0.
    * **The Catch:** Don't let that slightly higher gross rate for Inside IR35 fool you. Contractors overwhelmingly prefer Outside IR35 because the net take-home pay and business expenses make a huge difference. As one contractor put it, they "had to take a huge rate cut to get work" when moving to an Inside IR35 role, even if the gross rate seemed okay. This means Inside IR35 often feels like a pay cut in disguise.
* **Rates by Job Role:**
    * For **Outside IR35**, Solution Architects are raking it in (average £708.33), followed by Programme/Project Managers (£630.00). Developers are around £538.57.
    * For **Inside IR35**, Programme/Project Managers lead (£675.00), with Developers at £600.00.
* **Public vs. Private Sector Rates:**
    * In the **Private sector**, Outside IR35 averages £578.89, while Inside IR35 is higher at £632.73.
    * In the **Public sector**, Outside IR35 averages £600.00, but Inside IR35 is slightly lower at £578.57.
    * **The Public Sector Problem:** This is a big one. The public sector leans heavily on Inside IR35, and if their rates aren't truly competitive *after* all the tax implications, they're going to struggle to attract top talent. This could mean slower, less efficient public projects.

### **3.2. How Roles Are Found: Recruiters Rule (Especially in Public Sector)**

So, how are people actually getting these gigs in a tough market?



* **Top Channels:** "Via a recruiter/agency" (48.0%) and "Directly for past clients/colleagues" (28.7%) are the clear winners.
* **Public Sector's Agency Addiction:** The public sector relies *even more* heavily on recruiters (66.7%) compared to the private sector (40.4%). This suggests that if you want a public sector contract, an agency is almost a must.

</table>



### **3.3. IR35: The Great Divide (Public vs. Private, Big vs. Small)**

The data clearly shows that IR35 isn't applied equally across the board.



* **Public vs. Private:** The private sector is way more likely to offer Outside IR35 roles (69.7%), while the public sector is heavily skewed towards Inside IR35 (70.5%). This is a stark difference.
* **Company Size Matters:** Smaller companies (Startups and SMEs) are almost exclusively offering Outside IR35 contracts (100% and 82.8% respectively). But once you hit "Enterprise" level, it's a near 50/50 split between Inside and Outside.
* **Public Enterprise = Inside IR35:** If you're looking at a big public sector client, expect an Inside IR35 role (66.7% of the time).

This creates a "two-tiered" market. Contractors might have to choose between the stability of a large client (often Inside IR35) or the financial benefits of Outside IR35 (often with smaller, potentially less stable clients).

## **4. The Vibe: What's Really Bugging (and Boosting) Contractors**

Beyond the numbers, what's the overall mood in the UK IT contracting world?


### **4.1. Overall Outlook: Hanging On By a Thread**

The dominant feeling is a struggle. Over half (55.6%) are saying, "I will try to keep contracting, but it's getting harder." And nearly 20% are just throwing in the towel with "It's not worth it anymore." This isn't just a dip; it feels like a fundamental shift that's testing contractors' limits. If things don't improve, expect more people to jump ship.


### **4.2. What's Hitting Hardest (and What's Helping)**

We asked contractors to rate the personal impact of various market drivers. Here's what stood out:



* **The Big Bad:** The **IR35 reform** is the undisputed villain. A massive 58.6% said it had a "Highly negatively" impact, and another 22.9% said "Negatively." It's the top personal pain point, hands down.
* **Economic Headwinds:** **Economic uncertainty** (inflation, interest rates) and **Big tech lay-offs** are also hitting hard, with over 80% reporting negative impacts for each.
* **Brexit:** Still a net negative, but surprisingly, 40.6% felt "No impact."
* **The Double-Edged Swords:**
    * **Global remote-hiring:** This one's split. Some love the new opportunities (30.4% positive), but others feel the increased competition (44.9% negative).
    * **AI boom:** Similar story here. It's exciting for some (28.9% positive), but a threat to others (40.5% negative).
* **The Unexpected Hero:** **Covid-19** actually had a net *positive* impact for many (45.1% positive vs. 28.1% negative). This probably reflects the massive acceleration of remote work opportunities it brought.

## **Conclusion: A Crossroads for UK IT Contracting**

The UK IT contracting market is clearly at a crossroads. Experienced pros are feeling the squeeze, primarily from the IR35 reform with added pressure from the current economic climate and high interest rates. While the interest rates will fall, I think it's fair to say IR35 reform impact isn't just a temporary blip; it's a structural challenge that's making contracting less appealing.

The market has shifted from being a "seller's market" where talent was chased, to a "buyer's market" where contractors have to actively hunt for roles. And while remote work and AI offer some exciting new avenues, they also bring increased global competition.

If the UK wants to keep its flexible, highly skilled IT workforce, something's got to give. The current environment, especially around IR35, is pushing many to the brink. It's a tough time, but contractors are a resilient bunch – let's see if the market can adapt to keep them in the game.

## Is it worth switching to contracting for new people in 2025?

It is evidently much harder to do than it was 5 years ago. At the same time, four fifths of respondents would choose contracting over a full time job given an equal *take-home* pay. This goes to show that a huge fraction of contractors do it for the professional freedom and lifestyle that contracting enables. Businesses also need flexible workers, so I'm confident that despite IR35 reform setbacks there will be opportunities once interest rates start going down and investments in tech sector resume.

If having no annual 360 reviews and appraisals excites you, and you'd rather manage your own career progression instead of following a playbook; if planning your cash flows a bit more carefully in exchange for a cheeky no-guild 2 month gap between contracts sounds like a good deal - go for it.

Don't dive head first though - make sure you have an emergency fund to cover a few months of unexpected downtime (45% of respondents had unplanned downtime over the last 12 months!) or try and sign a contract before handing in your notice.
